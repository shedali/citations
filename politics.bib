Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioural surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as `machine intelligence', and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioural futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviour.'' https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook},

As neoconservative author Christopher Caldwell put it ``For the first time in centuries, Europeans are living in a world they did not, for the most part shape''. Brexit, Trumpism and the rise of far right movements across Europe are direct responses to this economic decline and perceived sense of cultural loss where with the replacement of the politics of ideology with the politics of identity in the post-Cold war era issues that are fundamentally political and economic are translated as cultural and ethnic problems, hence why migration is such a hot button and often emotive issue. Like Christopher Caldwell Murray feels the continent is a victim of an ongoing ``reverse colonisation'', In 2006 while giving a speech at the Pim Fortuyn memorial conference in the Dutch parliament, Murray, describing Muslims as a ``demographic time-bomb'' argued that ``Conditions for Muslims in Europe must be made harder across the board{\ldots}all immigration into Europe from Muslim countries must stop'' before ``a number of our largest cities fall to Muslim majorities''. Tommy Robinson in tweed. Katie Hopkins with an Oxbridge vocabulary. A cultured xenophobe. A clash of civilisations warrior. He is on a mission to expose how the combined evils of mass immigration, multiculturalism, political correctness, white guilt and secular materialist godlessness has emasculated Europeans of their cultural identity and spiritual heritage, leaving them ``jaded'' and ``guilty'', hence making them oblivious to confronting the Islamic threat that is increasingly creeping up on them. `Cultural enrichment' is the approved term for the West Indian's right to create an ear splitting cacophony for most of the night to the detriment of his neighbour's sanity, or for the Notting Hill Festival whose success or failure is judged by the level of street crime which accompanies it. He will cite polls revealing concerns among various European publics on the levels of immigration, but he ignores polls that show that people often greatly overestimate the number of immigrants in their society, and typically from those who live in areas with low immigrant populations. What is strange about Murray's ``Christianity'' (He's a self proclaimed Christian Atheist) is that it's not about belief in the truth claims of the gospels but about identity and symbolism, a form of Christian nationalism. His form of ``Christianity'' --- more specifically aesthetic Anglicanism --- is a political identity based on power and prestige that has as its symbols Christendom, Charlemagne and the Knight Templars with its prime antagonist being Islam. If you want to defend modern, secular, civilised, liberal democratic Europe then Murray is not your comrade. He is on the other side. If any of the authoritarian xenophobic, ultra nationalist so called populists gain power then we might as well begin writing our obituaries to our continental home. This is the true threat to Europe. The sooner we realise this the better.},
