Social dominance orientation (SDO) is one of the most powerful predictors of intergroup attitudes and behavior. Although SDO works well as a unitary construct, some analyses suggest it might consist of two complementary dimensions--SDO-Dominance (SDO-D), or the preference for some groups to dominate others, and SDO-Egalitarianism (SDO-E), a preference for nonegalitarian intergroup relations. Using seven samples from the United States and Israel, the authors confirm factor-analytic evidence and show predictive validity for both dimensions. In the United States, SDO-D was theorized and found to be more related to old-fashioned racism, zero-sum competition, and aggressive intergroup phenomena than SDO-E; SDO-E better predicted more subtle legitimizing ideologies, conservatism, and opposition to redistributive social policies. In a contentious hierarchical intergroup context (the Israeli-Palestinian context), SDO-D better predicted both conservatism and aggressive intergroup attitudes. Fundamentally, these analyses begin to establish the existence of complementary psychological orientations underlying the preference for group-based dominance and inequality.

@electronic{Rough:2019aa,
	annote = {Burnout is caused by chronic stress, not stressors, the Nagoskis say in their book. It's important to differentiate the two. Stressors are external: to-do lists, financial problems or anxiety about the future. Stress, on the other hand, ``is the neurological and physiological shift that happens in your body when you encounter [stressors],'' the Nagoskis write. To fix burnout, people need to address the stress itself. They must allow their body to complete its stress response cycle. Instead, people tend to focus on stressors. ``They assume their stress will go away if they're on top of things, if they're accomplishing things and constantly checking things off their to-do list,'' Emily Nagoski says. A study published in BMC Public Health showed that female physicians are susceptible to burnout from emotional exhaustion while male physicians to burnout because of cynicism. Making space in our lives so we're not so hurried and harried isn't easy, especially in a culture that shames slow living, Amelia Nagoski says. Preventing burnout requires hard decisions. Everyone has the same amount of time in a day: 24 hours. To rest --- whether with a walk, an extra hour of sleep or a talk with a friend --- means something else drops off the schedule. At first, you might panic that you're not ``accomplishing'' something. But before long, you may notice you've moved farther away from a breaking point. Your downward spiral will change directions.},

Of 16 variables the scientist explored, he described as ``most striking'' an association between the likelihood that a child would get hay fever allergy and the number of his or her siblings. It was an inverse relationship, meaning the more siblings the child had, the less likely it was that he or she would get the allergy. Not just that, but the children least likely to get allergies were ones who had older siblings. The paper hypothesized that ``allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children. ``Over the past century declining family size, improvements in household amenities, and higher standards of personal cleanliness have reduced the opportunity for cross infection in young families,'' the paper continued. ``This may have resulted in more widespread clinical expression of atopic disease, emerging in wealthier people, as seems to have occurred for hay fever. The percentage of children in the United States with a food allergy rose 50 percent between 1997--1999 and 2009--2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The jump in skin allergies was 69 percent during that period, leaving 12.5 percent of American children with eczema and other irritations. There are related trends in inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatic conditions and, in particular, celiac disease. The last results from the immune's system overreacting to gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. This attack, in turn, damages the walls of the small intestine.},

For it is humanly certain that most of us remember very little of what we have read. To open almost any book a second time is to be reminded that we had forgotten well-nigh everything that the writer told us. Parting from the narrator and his narrative, we retain only a fading impression; and he, as it were, takes the book away from us and tucks it under his arm. How much of reading, then, is just a kind of narcissism---a marker of who you were and what you were thinking when you encountered a text?

March 23, 2019 144 make your goals explicit . March 23, 2019 144 If you're concerned with minimizing maximum lateness, then the best strategy is to start with the task due soonest and work your way toward the task due last. This strategy, known as Earliest Due Date , is fairly intuitive. March 23, 2019 145 Maybe instead we want to minimize the number of foods that spoil. Here a strategy called Moore's Algorithm gives us our best plan. Moore's Algorithm says that we start out just like with Earliest Due Date---by scheduling out our produce in order of spoilage date, earliest first, one item at a time. However, as soon as it looks like we won't get to eating the next item in time, we pause, look back over the meals we've already planned, and throw out the biggest item (that is, the one that would take the most days to consume). March 23, 2019 145 Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. ---LAO TZU March 23, 2019 146 Minimizing the sum of completion times leads to a very simple optimal algorithm called Shortest Processing Time : always do the quickest task you can.
