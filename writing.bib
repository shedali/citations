Perhaps Ovenden's finest achievement in Burning the Books is to demonstrate the importance and enduring power of preserved knowledge, whether in clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, bound codices, printed books or digital bytes. `Rulers wanted to have information that would help them to decide the optimal time to go to war, plant a crop, harvest a crop, and so on,' Ovenden writes of the cuneiform tablets of ancient Mesopotamia. `Today, the future continues to be dependent on access to the knowledge of the past and will be even more so as digital technology changes the way we can predict what will happen.'

There is `linkrot', those links that lead you to websites that are no longer available. There are denial-of-service-type cyberattacks, like the one that crippled Estonia in 2007

There is `fake news', as well as `alternative facts', and the manipulation or intentional erasure of data.

Ovenden sees the emergence of `private knowledge kingdoms' and `surveillance capitalism' as particular threats: a `disproportionate amount of the world's memory has now been outsourced to tech companies without society realising the fact or really being able to comprehend the consequences'.

famous observation of the 19th-century German poet Heinrich Heine, `Whenever they burn books, they will also, in the end, burn people.'
