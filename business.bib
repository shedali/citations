	abstract = {	proximity boosts productivity

	But other types of work hinge on what might be called ``collaborative efficiency''---the speed at which a group successfully solves a problem. And distance seems to drag collaborative efficiency down. Why? The short answer is that collaboration requires communication. And the communications technology offering the fastest, cheapest, and highest-bandwidth connection is---for the moment, anyway---still the office.

	Yet all of these technologies have a weakness, which is that we have to choose to use them

	Back in 1977, the MIT professor Thomas J. Allen looked at communication patterns among scientists and engineers and found that the farther apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. At the 30-meter mark, the likelihood of regular communication approached zero.

	The communications tools that were supposed to erase distance, it turns out, are used largely among people who see one another face-to-face.},

@techreport{michael-gibbs:2021,
	abstract = {Using personnel and analytics data from over 10,000 skilled professionals at a large Asian IT ser- vices company, we compare productivity before and during the work from home [WFH] period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Total hours worked increased by roughly 30%, including a rise of 18% in working after normal business hours. Average output did not significantly change. Therefore, productivity fell by about 20%. Time spent on coordination activities and meetings increased, but uninterrupted work hours shrank considerably. Employees also spent less time networking, and re- ceived less coaching and 1:1 meetings with supervisors. These findings suggest that communication and coordination costs increased substantially during WFH, and constituted an important source of the decline in productivity. Employees with children living at home increased hours worked more than those without children at home, and suffered a bigger decline in productivity than those without children.
